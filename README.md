# React-starter

- CLI  
- Config File  
- Dev Server  
- Loaders  
- Production Builds  

Looking for the perfect react development boilerplate

This is a WIP.

- hjs-webpack
- bootstrap 3

1 - Clone  
2 - Change Names (root folder & package.json)  
3 - Run scripts


## Scripts  

`npm install` -> install dependencies  
`npm run build` -> create 'build/' folder   
`npm start` -> run development server

on the browser:  
`http://localhost:3000`


### TODO

- yeoman generator
- create own hjs-webpack
- ability to choose different css frameworks
- Lots of things :P
